<br/>

I am currently working in the [Tissue Mechanics Lab](http://www.tml.gatech.edu/) at the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology. I received a Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology (Advisor: [Dr. Wei Sun](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Wei-Sun)), in 2020. Previously, I received a B.Eng. degree in Mechatronic Engineering from Zhejiang University, in 2015.

My research interests include cardiovascular biomechanics, inverse methods, and machine learning.
