I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Tissue Mechanics Lab](http://www.tml.gatech.edu/) at the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University. I received a Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology, in 2020 (advisor: [Dr. Wei Sun](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/faculty/Wei-Sun), co-advisor: [Dr. H. Jerry Qi](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/qi)). Previously, I received a B.Eng. degree in Mechatronic Engineering from Zhejiang University, in 2015.

My research interests include:
* Identification of constitutive parameters by solving inverse problems.
* Machine learning applications in biomechanics.
* Computational patient-specific cardiovascular modeling.
* Experimental characterization and constitutive modeling of cardiovascular tissues.
* Uncertainty quantification in computational biomechanics
